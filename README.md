# Nix config

## Install `nix`

### macOS

In order to perform a multi-user install of `nix` on macOS, follow these steps.

The first order of business is to make sure `diskutil` is in your `$PATH`. If
it isn't, add it

```sh
$ export PATH=/usr/sbin:$PATH
```

Now you can go ahead and run the installer

```sh
sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --darwin-use-unencrypted-nix-store-volume --daemon
```

This should take you throught the process in a nice and straight-forward way.

Once the installation finishes, it should print something like

Try it! Open a new terminal, and type:

```sh
nix-shell -p nix-info --run "nix-info -m"
```

It's possible that this won't work straight away, and you may get something like

```
error: could not set permissions on '/nix/var/nix/profiles/per-user' to 755: Operation not permitted
```

Don't worry. The issue is very likely that the `nix-daemon` isn't up and
running just yet. Give it a few seconds and try again.

**A note on SSL issues:** If you're getting errors like

```
Problem with the SSL CA cert (path? access rights?) (77)
```

at later stages, there might be that `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt` is a
dead symlink. This can be fixed by removing that file and creating a new
symlink

```
sudo ln -s /nix/var/nix/profiles/default/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
```

#### Flakes

Now we're ready to bootstrap and install the actual configuration. First, we
need to install `nixFlakes` in our environment.

```
$ nix-env -iA nixpkgs.nixFlakes
```

Then we need to edit `/etc/nix/nix.conf` and add:

```
experimental-features = nix-command flakes
```

Once that's done, we should be able to bootstrap the system with a minimal
configuration.

```sh
nix build .#darwinConfigurations.bootstrap.system
./result/sw/bin/darwin-rebuild switch --flake .#bootstrap
```

Open up a new terminal session and run

```
$ darwin-rebuild switch --flake .#macbook
```

Tada! Everything should be installed and ready to go.

**NOTE:** It's a good idea to make sure that any existing installation of
`nix-darwin` is uninstalled before you begin. There may be crap remaining in
`/etc/static`. Also, you should remeber to backup existing etc files

```
$ sudo mv /etc/bashrc /etc/bashrc.backup-before-darwin
$ sudo mv /etc/zshrc /etc/zshrc.backup-before-darwin
```

**NOTE 2:** It's also possible that you may have to backup `nix.conf` in order for
`nix-darwin` to be able to link it

```
$ sudo mv /etc/nix/nix.conf /etc/nix/nix.conf.backup-before-darwin
```

**NOTE 3:** `nix-darwin` might also complain about linking `ca-certificates.crt`. That
stuff we may or may not have had to take care of earlier. Just back that up,
rebuild, and watch `nix-darwin` link it.
